# Rupe C 21/10/23 - Py Homework 1.  Create a program to calc the perimeter of a triangle. 
# Calc the preimeter length of a regular or non regular polygon

########### START PSUDOCODE ################
#Prompts the user to input the name of the shape for which the perimeter is to be calculated.
#Declares a dictionary of shapes and their corresponding number of sides.
#Set the number of sides based on the shape name and checks for spelling errors.
#Input measurement units.
#As squares are regular, the program sets the number of sides to 4 and asks for the length of one side.
#If regular, the program asks for the length of one side and sets the length of all sides to be the same.
#If not regular, the program asks for the length of each side.
#Sum the lengths of all sides.
#Format the perimeter as a number with commas and as words using the num2words library.
#Prints the perimeter of the shape in words and in numbers.
